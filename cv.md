## __About Myself__
My aim is to develop my skills on JavaScrypt. 
I don't have some professional knowledge and huge experience. But I'm a second-year student in the Minsk Radioengineering College.
I'm in the way of being a Frontend Developer.
In my opinion, I have enough strength, time and motivation to learn how to programme.

## __Education__
I have finished 9 grades at school, and then I have got in the college.
My specialization is "Information technology software" so we specialize on working with a "brain" of computer.
But when I was in the 8th grade, I took courses "Codewarts" where we learned basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## __English__
According to the test, my level is B1/B2
I always have good marks on this subject.
Moreover, I have been studying in the popular school languages "Streamline" for almost a year.
Also, I know another 2 languages: Russian(my native) and Belorussian(I have learnt it in school).
